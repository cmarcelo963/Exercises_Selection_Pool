Are you looking for exercises to practise what you've learnt so far? <br>
Look no further :)

## Printing, For Loops and IF, ELSE Statements
As much as you would like to say that this is easy, the purpose of these exercises is to further practise your ability to code and not to teach you how to code. There is a way on how to do it differently/easily by manually printing the characters from exercises 4 and beyond, but please note that this will help you practise the the intended coding procedures if done manually.
1. Print ```'A'```
2. Print ```'J'```
3. Print ```'Z'```
4. Print ```"Hello World!"```
5. Print ```"I can code now!"```
6. Print ```"I can do this all day!"```
7. Print the first half backwards of the given string - ```"flah ts1 eht si sihTflah dn2 eht si sihT"```
8. Print the second half backwards of the given string - ```"flah ts1 eht si sihTflah dn2 eht si sihT"```
9. Print the first half of this string - ```"This is the 1st halfThis is the 2nd half"```
10. Print the second half of this string - ```"This is the 1st halfThis is the 2nd half"```
11. Print every two characters of this string starting from the first character
```"TkHpIqS  sIhS  pDzOhNTE  ICGOgRJRVEQCNTALZY"```
12. Print every characters in this string in which their position is divisible by 3
```"POWiuedflxcl   poDjiojhnrte./!"```
13. Print the given string and change every 'z' or 'Z' into 'o' or 'O' - ```"I knzw hzw tz czde nzw!"```
14. Print the last word of the given string - ```"First word means more than the last"```


## Printing Numbers in Pair
1. Print two numbers counting from 00 to 99. Must separate each numbers with a comma(,) and end the code with a new line.
2. Print two numbers counting from 99 to 00. Must separate each numbers with a comma(,) and end the code with a new line.
3. Print two numbers counting from 10 to 98 in which the first digit can never be lower or equal to the second digit. Must separate each numbers with a comma(,) and end the code with a new line.
4. Print two numbers counting from 98 to 10 in which the first digit can never be lower or equal to the second digit. Must separate each numbers with a comma(,) and end the code with a new line.
5. Print two numbers counting from 01 to 89 in which the second digit can never be lower or equal to the first digit. Must separate each numbers with a comma(,) and end the code with a new line.
6. Print two numbers counting from 89 to 01 in which the second digit can never be lower or equal to the first digit. Must separate each numbers with a comma(,) and end the code with a new line.
